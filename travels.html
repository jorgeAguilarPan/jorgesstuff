							<font color="0">June 2021 - The family took a two week 
											trip to the smoky mountans. I joined them 
											a couple of days after they arrived. We stayed
											in Mars Hill, a very small rural town about 
											half an hour outside of Asheville. I'd been 
											in the area before, but this time was a lot more
											memorable.
											</font>
											<br>
							<font color="0">Driving the Blue Ridge Highway had been on my
											list for sometime and this was my first time in
											the area since learning to drive. I wasted no 
											time.
											</font>
											<br>
							<font color="0">The Blue Ridege Mountains are truly spectacular.
											The area is covered in temperate rainforests and 
											the humidity remains very high year round. This is
											most evident in the early mornings. Reaching the 
											nearest highway entrance around 4-5 am, the fog is 
											so thick that visibility is extremely limited (to
											maybe about 5-10 meters). Beyond that distance, 
											the path becomes totally obscured. Driving faster 
											than 50 km/h is quite dangerous. The feeling is amazing,
											however. Nothing quite compares to driving and walking
											inside the clouds. Several hiking trails straddle
											the length of the highway. The highest point on 
											the highway is not too far from Mars Hill.
											</font>
											<br>
							<font color="0">The only disappointment of this trip was I was still
											unable to find any pawpaws.

											<br>
							<font color="0">We reached Québec city and stayed stayed on the Southern
											coast of the St. Lawrence. Things got really interesting around here.
											The Gaspésie is nowhere near as populous as Upper Québec; and this 
											was immediately noticeable. Services are also very widely spread 
											apart. The car out of gas near Rivière-du-Loup and we had 
											to wait until morning to fill up. We followed the 
											road sticking to the coast further West. The coast 
											gets pretty jagged and mountainous with steep 
											cliffs facing the water and towns.
											</font>
											<br>
							<font color="0">Eventually we arrived at Forillon National Park. 
											The peninsula narrows and the road ends. The last
											three and a half kilometers are an upward hike 
											towards the End of the World (Le but du Monde). While 
											the plan was to camp out here or in the vicinity 
											we were forced to turn back early to make my 
											citizenship ceremony back in Chicago. We continued on 
											to Percé just under an hour down the road. We stopped 
											here for a day. Watching the sun rise by the rock 
											was truly spectacular.
											</font>
											<br>
							<font color="0">After this, we started the trip back home. We straddled
											the coast until we reached Moncton and the followed
											the fastest road back home. Arriving in Ohio we made 
											the decision to visit a friend studying at Miami.
